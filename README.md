# `unicirc` - Unitary synthesis with optimal brick wall circuits

Here we present a small Python package defining quantum circuits with a brick wall structure,
providing numerical tools to check necessary conditions for their universality, and implementing
variational optimization workflows to compile typical unitaries to them.

The code used to produce the data and figures in the preprint "Unitary synthesis with optimal
brick wall circuits" is enclosed as well.

The repository is structured as follows:

- `pyproject.toml` defines the Python package `unicirc`
- `unicirc/` contains the source code for the Python package `unicirc`
- `tests/` contains tests for the `unicirc` package
- `scripts/` contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts to run numerical tests,
  execute variational workflows, and plot results
